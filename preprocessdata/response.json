On the other hand, current techniques around EMR takes the doctors' eyes away from the patient, to type patient data via a computer screen.

Cooey aims to be known the \u201cWhatsApp\u201d of healthcare or digital real estate where everyone is hooked in and get effective answers in the simplest form possible.\n\nAn overwhelming percentage of chronically ill, elderly patients go through the painful process of logging their homecare medical data & availing recurring services. Further, there is lack of mechanism to capture comprehensive medical history or service targeting for hospital. And you need solutions that are dynamic, holistic, personalized, and more importantly easily understandable.\n\nWith Cooey\u2019s solution, patients can minimize their visits to hospitals or labs and get personalized insights on their medical condition while staying connected with their doctors. Thus, empowering them to make informed decisions on their medical condition.\n\nSo far, the Health IT includes Hospital Information System (HIS) and other products/apps, but still there is a missing last mile link, engagement with patient. Cooey is that missing shoe in this entire process. It\u2019s the 3rd platform for chronic patient health management. 3rd Platform is about engaging patients to health management system and providing targeted services to them.\n\nTo maximize the opportunities further in elderly care & remote monitoring, in December 2016, Cooey launched its next product, MyCooey, a comprehensive platform exclusively for elderly care management and remote care coordination. It connects patients, caregivers, and family members irrespective of the location they are in. It\u2019s a combination of smart devices, mobile apps and a web portal. MyCooey has now close to 40,000 patients and caregivers as users across the globe, and demonstrated how one can leverage best practices and enable better patient engagement, more effective communication and care coordination among the patient community and caregivers."
